# PS_CityInfo
yet another pluralsight course which after having taken an online test and not barely passing because 
I couldn't connect to their api I decided learn a bit about api development.

This project is soppose to be a RESTful api using ASP.NET Core and 
although when the project runs nothing appears and I get a screen saying error code soemthing 
its actually works. The data contained in the db are cities and each city may contain 
1 or more points of interest/tourist spots

since this was meant to be an api nothing is shown on a web page but when a proper request is made 
and you go to developer tools you can see the output being displayed I used postman throughout the 
project to run all my request and do my testing with request such as get, post, put, patch, and delete.

one cool feature/ service that was added was the ability to send out an email when ever a particular point of interest was added.

I made a recording of how it looks like when it runs and the results of some of the request however the file is to "large" to include in here.
